# Part 2: How do neural networks learn

## What even are neural networks

### Why are they called "neural" networks

### What is a perceptron

### Is one perceptron enough

### How many is enough

### What are activation functions and why are they inserted between linear functions

### What is a softmax function

## How to create a good model

### How do we intialize all the parameters in the model

### How to train a model

### How does the model update the weights on its own

### How much monitoring is required

### Is more training always good

### What is data drift

## Why do neural networks work

### What is the universal approximation theorem

### What is Information Theory of Deep Learning
