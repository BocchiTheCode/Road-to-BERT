# Part 1: How to handle text input

## Converting text into numbers

All Machine Learning Models are mathematical functions and they can only take numerical input. For a model to be able to handle text data it is necessary that we pass the text through a tokenizer and generate token embeddings.

### What is a tokenizer

### Are there different ways of splitting the text

### Which splitting technique is more meaningful

### Why is it important for tokens to be meaningful

### How do we get the embeddings of each token
